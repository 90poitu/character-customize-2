# A simple character customize

## Screenshots
### intro
  I've made a character customization system. You can customize your character into any colour you desire. For the locked colours you need a total of 1000 coins to unlock each colour you want to customize into your character. This system is good because you can customize your character and enjoy customizing your character into your desired colour.
